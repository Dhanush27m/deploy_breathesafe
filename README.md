## What This Project Does

BreatheSafe is a full-stack AI platform that helps people in Indian cities make health-conscious decisions around air quality. It provides:

- **Real-time AQI monitoring** for 29 major Indian cities, updated every hour automatically from satellite and weather data sources (no paid API keys needed).
- **1/3/7-day AQI forecasts** per city using XGBoost models trained on 3.5 years of historical data (942,761 rows, 27 features including lag patterns, seasonal encodings, weather, and pollution chemistry).
- **PAERI personalised health risk scoring** — a risk index that takes your health profile (age, conditions like asthma or heart disease, smoking status, pregnancy, activity level) and calculates a 0–100 personal risk score for any AQI reading, not just a generic category.
- **Pollution-aware route planning** — given a start and end point anywhere in India, generates fastest / cleanest / balanced route options with AQI exposure scores for each, backed by OSRM routing.
- **SHAP explainability** — every forecast comes with feature importance explanations: which factors (e.g. lag from yesterday, monsoon season, temperature) drove the predicted AQI.
- **Smart email alerts** — HTML emails sent on route save (showing risk score, journey details, and personalised recommendations), plus ongoing AQI monitoring emails if conditions change before your planned trip.
- **JWT authentication** with automatic token refresh — sessions stay alive for 7 days without re-login.

## Hosting Stack

**Free cloud stack: Vercel + Render + Supabase — $0/month**

See **[HOSTING_GUIDE.md](./HOSTING_GUIDE.md)** for full step-by-step deployment instructions.

| Service | Role | Free Tier Used |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Vercel | React/Vite frontend (static CDN) | ~30 min of 6,000 build minutes |
| Render | FastAPI backend (Docker, 1 worker) | ~720 of 750 instance hours/month |
| Supabase | PostgreSQL database | ~78 MB of 500 MB |

## Key Differences: Dev vs Deploy Version

| | Dev (`breathesafe/`) | Deploy (`deploy_breathesafe/`) |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend serving | Vite dev server (HMR) | nginx static (multi-stage Docker) |
| Frontend port | 5173 | 5174 (local) / Vercel (cloud) |
| Backend port | 8000 | 8001 (local) / `$PORT` (cloud) |
| DB port | 5432 | 5434 (local) / Supabase pooler (cloud) |
| uvicorn workers | 1 (dev reload) | 1 (prevents double pipeline runs) |
| ML models | Docker volume | Committed to git (`backend/ml/models/`) |
| Hot reload | Yes | No |
| Data pipeline | Manual | Auto (APScheduler hourly) |

---

## Running Locally (Docker)

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

| Service | Local URL |
|---------|-----------|
| Frontend | http://localhost:5174 |
| Backend API | http://localhost:8001 |
| API Docs | http://localhost:8001/docs |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5434 |

Database migrations and city seeding run automatically on container start (via the Dockerfile CMD). No manual steps needed.

---

## ML Models

The trained XGBoost models live in `backend/ml/models/` and are **committed to git** so Render's Docker build bakes them into the image. No training happens at deploy time.

**Model v2.0 details:**
- Trained on 942,761 rows of hourly data (Aug 2022 – May 2026)
- 27 features: temporal encodings, 5 lag windows (24h/48h/72h/168h/336h), 4 rolling averages, rolling std devs, and current weather conditions
- One model per city (29 total)
- Training time: ~10–15 minutes on a local machine
- `metadata.json` in `backend/ml/models/` records exact training date, rows, features, and per-city MAE/RMSE

**When to retrain:** Every 3–6 months, or when forecast accuracy visibly degrades. Run from the `backend/` folder:
```bash
python train_models.py --csv ..\data\aqi_india_enriched.csv --skip-prophet --models-dir ml\models
```
Then commit the updated `.joblib` files and push. Render redeploys automatically.

**Keeping the training CSV updated:**
```bash
# From deploy_breathesafe/ folder — pulls new rows from Supabase into the local CSV
python sync_csv.py
```
The CSV is at `data/aqi_india_enriched.csv` (956,043 rows as of May 2026). Run `sync_csv.py` before retraining to include the latest data.

---

## Data Pipeline (Automatic)

The backend runs a fully automatic data pipeline on Render. Every hour:

1. APScheduler triggers `run_pipeline()` for all 29 cities
2. For each city, fetches weather from **Open-Meteo** (temperature, wind, humidity, pressure, precipitation, dew point, cloud cover, gusts)
3. Fetches pollutants from **CAMS air quality API** (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, dust, aerosol optical depth)
4. Computes India AQI using the **CPCB formula** locally
5. Inserts new rows into Supabase with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` (idempotent)
6. If the app restarts after a long idle (Render cold start), it auto-detects the gap and uses the archive endpoints to backfill missing hours

The pipeline handles gaps of any size — short gaps (under 5 days) use the recent API, longer gaps use the historical archive APIs with date-range queries.

---

## Authentication

- JWT access tokens (24-hour expiry) + refresh tokens (7-day expiry)
- **Automatic token refresh** in the frontend axios interceptor: when a 401 is received on any request, the app silently calls `/auth/refresh`, updates the stored token, and retries the original request — no re-login needed unless both tokens expire
- On app startup, `AuthContext` validates the stored token via `/auth/me` to catch expiry early

## Notes

**SMTP email:** Uses Gmail App Password (not the account password) with `aiosmtplib 3.0.1` on port 587 with STARTTLS. The `EMAIL_FROM`, `SMTP_USER`, and `SMTP_PASSWORD` env vars must be set in Render's dashboard for emails to send in production.

**Single uvicorn worker:** The Dockerfile intentionally uses `--workers 1`. Multiple workers would each start their own APScheduler and run the pipeline simultaneously, causing duplicate DB inserts and wasted API calls.

**Token refresh:** The frontend axios interceptor automatically refreshes expired access tokens using the stored refresh token. If the refresh token is also expired, the user is redirected to `/login`. This means users stay logged in for up to 7 days without any action.

**90-day data retention:** A daily scheduled job deletes `aqi_data` rows older than 90 days. This keeps the database permanently bounded at ~70–80 MB on the free Supabase tier regardless of how long the service runs.

**Model retraining:** Not needed at deploy time. Models were trained locally and committed to git. Retrain every 3–6 months using `sync_csv.py` to update the training data first, then `train_models.py`.
